## TL;DR

Hey, I'm swyx! I help build great developer experiences, from documentation to dev tools to dev communities.

I am currently [Head of DX at Temporal.io](https://www.swyx.io/why-temporal/), based out of Seattle.
I am also a frequent writer and speaker best known for the [Learn in Public](https://swyx.io/LIP) movement and recently published [The Coding Career Handbook](https://learninpublic.org) with more advice for engineers going from Junior to Senior.

P.S. "swyx" is the initials of my English and Chinese names and you can use it interchangeably with "Shawn". It is pronounced "swicks".

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/swyx) and [Github](https://github.com/sw-yx)!
