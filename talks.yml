Shawn also talks about his book, "The Coding Career Handbook", and how it started as a side project as well. We also talk about the importance of writing your own blog posts, and sharing your experience and learning in public to help both yourself and others, rather than blogging for numbers. We wrap up with a discussion on being a part-time creator, and finding a company that supports their employees and match what you're looking to do.

  description: 7 years after release, React reaches millions of developers and billions of users. Its ideas have influenced other frameworks, even those in other languages like Swift UI and Jetpack Compose. What’s next? The community has been hard at work innovating in React formats, metaframeworks, and developer tooling. This fits an established pattern of how developer languages grow, and likely forms a roadmap for React in the Third Age of JavaScript.

Therefore most performance differences, especially the ones we can control, are down to our "OS" - our conscious prioritization and processing - and "firmware" - our unconscious personality and reactions. What can we do to better take care of our "hardware", and what does running better "software" look like?

  description: 7 years after release, React reaches millions of developers and billions of users. Its ideas have influenced other frameworks, even those in other languages like Swift UI and Jetpack Compose. What’s next? The community has been hard at work innovating in React formats, metaframeworks, and developer tooling. This fits an established pattern of how developer languages grow, and likely forms a roadmap for React in the Third Age of JavaScript.

  description: Modern JS frameworks have run into a quandary - what we write is what we ship. Despite our best efforts at minifying and treeshaking, we cannot fight the fact that adding features means adding JS bundle size. This means we are often trading off user experience against developer experience for every fatiguing decision we make. But it doesn't have to be this way. As Tom Dale predicted, Compilers are the new Frameworks. Svelte is an exciting, newer JavaScript framework that was designed from the ground up with compilation and speed. In this talk, we'll look under its hood to understand how it works, so you know when and why you'd want to use it in future. Don't worry, it isn't Rocket Science!

This will serve two purposes – to demonstrate the effective use of closures, and to show how you can build a Hooks clone in just 29 lines of readable JS. Finally, we arrive at how you get Custom Hooks and the Rules of Hooks out of this incredible mental model!

  description: Babel macros are a new way to solve DX and UX tradeoffs by metaprogramming to write code the way that is best for you while delivering code that is best for the user. Case in point, JSX - but why stop there? In this talk we explore how I wrote babel-blade to solve the double declaration problem in clientside GraphQL libraries, and how to get started writing your first babel macro!

  misc:
    - cfp: Hi organizers! Babel is a core part of the JS ecosystem, and I think still very underexplored/underappreciated because of the perception that it is hard to get into and limited to transpiling JSX and TC39 proposals. With the increasing adoption of babel-plugin-macros (adopted by large ecosystems like React) the addressable space for babel has -exploded-. Essentially making it possible to move computation and metaprogramming from run time to build time making for faster apps -and- a better developer experience! I want to tell the world!!

  description: There is a lot of developer and investment interest in JAMStack technologies, from the serverless movement to new authentication models to continuous atomic deployment to the static site generator renaissance. But with so many new terms and options, it is hard for people to figure out where to start. This workshop will teach developers to set up a simple but state of the art Gatsby and Netlify stack, which lets people create blazing fast sites and apps with React and GraphQL, backed up by a continuous deployment and serverless platform complete with authentication and CMS. It has never been easier to get a great Lighthouse score, or to deploy complex, secure webapps for free.

  desc: An introduction to the JAMstack from a historical perspective as the next evolution from LAMP and MEAN stacks
  description: 20 years ago, Michael Kunze coined the LAMP stack to describe the success of open source architecture on the web, but it also betrayed the server-centric world of the time. 5 years ago, Val Karpov described the MEAN stack as a JavaScript centric alternative straddling frontend and backend worlds. A lot has happened since then. React rose to dominance, AWS Lambda started the Serverless movement, the "API economy" arose to serve developers, and Static Site Generators came back in a big way. What is driving this new stack of Javascript, APIs, and Markup?
  misc:
    - You will learn about the historical context of developer focus and product differentiation moving from backend to frontend
    - You will be able to explain the problems with serverful architecture
    - You will have a better understanding of the growing startup and open source ecosystem building around the JAMstack
    - You will be able to explain what exactly the fuss is about the JAMstack

  desc: This show-and-tell session will look at what you can do with serverless functions, how to get started creating and locally testing them with Netlify Dev, and finally deploying them as Netlify Functions with atomic deployments and instant rollbacks.
  description: Making dynamic app functionality on the JAMstack often involves writing custom APIs as "glue code", "token hiders" and other business logic traditionally done on the server. Even _without_ a JAMstack architecture, serverless functions can be a great add-on, autoscaling solution for additional functionality for existing apps. It should be -easy- to spin up these serverless functions, but learning, testing and deploying them can often be more trouble than they are worth. This show-and-tell session will look at what you can do with serverless functions, how to get started creating and locally testing them with Netlify Dev, and finally deploying them as Netlify Functions with atomic deployments and instant rollbacks. Static has never looked this dynamic!

    "TypeScript is increasingly being adopted in React apps at scale, from AirBnb to Shopify to Atlassian. In this live coding talk, we walk through best practices and introduce everything you need to know to get started, WITHOUT getting lost in arcane generic type logic!

    The theme of this talk is showing how TypeScript (TS) tooling helps write and document apps at scale. We'll do:

    - a live coding demo of starting with typescript for react devs
    - end with some resources and discussions of pitfalls"

  description: The need for immutability in JavaScript isn’t obvious, but Immutable.js swept the Javascript world in 2015 when it enforced a stricter, more functional approach to code without any need for deep comparisons. Then Immer was introduced in 2018, and took the Javascript world by storm. What's different? What's better? And what do ES6 Proxies have to do with it?

  description: A new front-end stack is emerging, with one theme - constraints that scale. They involve building Design Systems for visual consistency, using TypeScript for internal consistency, Apollo GraphQL for data manipulation, and server- or statically-rendered React for data representation. In this talk we explore how these trends fit together, and _why_ leading product teams from AirBnb to the New York Times are embracing them.

    description3: Babel-Macros were shipped with Babel v7 - but what are they? What can you do with them? In this lightning talk we discuss how babel macros differ from plugins, and my recent work with babel-blade creating an inline GraphQL compiler that works with all clientside GraphQL clients.
    graphqlasianotes: No technical requirements apart from internet connection. I am the best person to speak on the subject because I made this macro https://babel-blade.netlify.com. Initially it was just a cool toy but then people at Coursera, Netflix, FB, and Adobe have picked up it telling me to keep going so I am applying for a lightning talk so I can spread the idea and get feedback/collaboration with the major clientside GraphQL clients!
