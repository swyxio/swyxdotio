  description: This week we're joined by Shawn Wang, Senior Developer Advocate at AWS and author of the excellent Coding Career Handbook. Shawn is a career-switcher; he transitioned into tech in his early thirties after a career in finance. He has written a lot about how aspiring devs can better accelerate their careers, and his views are nuanced and full of wisdom that's very relevant to all aQoC listeners (no matter what stage you're at in your career).

  notes: "It was a dream to chat with Amelia Wattenberger on her new podcast. I've admired her work for a long time. I wish I had asked them more questions as they are experienced book authors, but then again, I was the guest. I love their backlog of questions as well."

    We discuss what exactly Netlify is, and how you can leverage the Edge, Build, and Dev aspect of it to make your development process more enjoyable.

    We talk about the challenges of maintaining Author Experience (AX) in the age of static site generators, using Live Preview functions in a CMS or service to help out.

    We also talk about how JavaScript edge workers will gain sentience as Skynet, and the AI language model that was so dangerous they couldnt release it.'

  desc: Shawn Wang talks about how learning in public was the single best thing he did for his career.
  description: You can learn in private, or you can learn in public. 99% of developers work and learn privately in the shadows, so why shouldn't you? Something magical happened when Shawn started creating resources and sharing what he learned in public. More advanced people began to help him by correcting him when he was wrong. By learning publically, he was able to both teach and learn at the same time!
  comments: This was actually recorded in March, I think, when I was in Tampa ahead of VueConf. I recall frantically driving back to do the recording and getting stuck in traffic and texting Kent that I would be late! I don't like driving so this was a high stress period.

  desc: One of my better podcast discussions of Learn In Public. The sequence of how this one happened was pretty fun. I noticed an a11y fight on Twitter, and posted about it on the Netlify slack. then Leslie picked up the torch and [wrote a blogpost about it](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/02/25/accessibility-is-not-a-react-problem/). That got her invited onto the podcast and she became a panelist. And then she invited me. and now we're here.
  description: Today’s guest Shawn Wang is a career changer starts off the show about how he got from finance to programming. The panel talks about how they each got started in programming. Shawn explains his Learn In Public manifesto. They discuss the benefits of learning in public and how concepts like Cunninham’s Law and lampshading can be a good thing. Shawn talks about the differences between inbound and outbound marketing. The two biggest benefits of learning in public is that people will come to help you, it helps you to build capital, and it os the fastest way to learn. They discuss the balance between sharing too little and oversharing.

    ## No Code

    - Why is no code interesting to Software Engineers?
    - Business opportunity
    - Developer productivity
    - Should no code users be worried about platform lockin?
    - Yes
    - We have to understand what the good abstractions are and where complexity overtakes convenience
    - Software Engineers have a unique advantage here
    - What duties should no code platforms fulfil? just UI layer? Shopify store? What are the borders?
    - Nothing definite yet
    - [Webflow Blogpost: No Code is a Lie](https://webflow.com/blog/no-code-is-a-lie)
    - But everything can have a GUI layer - leading the API economy to transform into the GUI economy
    - Even the Vue ecosystem has added a [UI on top of their CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/dev-guide/ui-api.html)
    - State machines in UI Development - [David Khourshid at React Rally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU1NKX6Qkxc)
    - visual IDEs are winning over text editors
    - [Bret Victor - the Future of Programming](https://vimeo.com/71278954)
    - **EDIT: THINGS I FORGOT TO MENTION**
    - Shopify and Wordpress are basically No Code platforms on top of Rails and PHP
    - there is also a trend of big platforms implementing internal no-code solutions:
    - [Slack Workflow Builder](https://slack.com/intl/en-sg/help/articles/360035692513-Guide-to-Workflow-Builder)
    - [Asana No Code solution](https://webflow.com/nocodeconf/session/making-automation-feel-more-human)
    - [Salesforce No Code](https://webflow.com/nocodeconf/session/progressive-enhancement-a-mindset-for-designing-no-code-platforms)
    - [iOS Shortcuts was an acquisition](https://thesweetsetup.com/ios-shortcuts-guide/)
    - What is available in the GUI economy?
    - CSS
    - CMS
    - Ecommerce
    - PaaS
    - As developers, we use no code tools in our daily work
    - Nobody wants to use Passport.js anymore, we rather farm it out to Okta and Auth0

    ## JAMstack

    - What is the JAMstack?
    - [Jamstack Conf](https://jamstackconf.com/)
    - [Jamstack.org](http://jamstack.org/)
    - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
    - How do you compare JAMstack to No Code?
    - Very comparable - JAMstack is 'No Code backend' - serves frontend developers
    - But there are more people who just aren't developers at all
    - Non developers need a bit more handholding - frontend devs can at least help debug
    - JAMstack vs No Code is similar to Figma vs Canva
    - What code are you writing in the JAMstack?
    - Frontend + Glue code
    - In a No Code stack, you have to find your own frontend
    - heavily overlapping paradigms
    - Can go from No Code to JAMstack often, but not other way round
    - Are enterprises building JAMstack applications?

    - JAMstack as the counterpart to serverless
    - Precompilation in the JAMstack - help me understand Gatsby
    - Gatsby < React < JS
    - Gatsby helps give a good default Webpack config for performance
    - Webpack allows modules, preprocessing of code and images etc
    - Having build steps has problems, but is a net benefit for users by shipping more optimal
    - Gatsby allows you to pull in data pipeline aka content mesh

    ## Code

    - React vs Vue
    - Vue easier to start with
    - React has more jobs
    - FB dogfoods React
    - React as a universal UI language
    - Tom Dale - [Compilers are the new Frameworks](https://tomdale.net/2017/09/compilers-are-the-new-frameworks/)
    - Difference between SSR and Compiling
    - SSR generates HTML
    - Compiling framework runtime/footprint
    - React is trying to help optimize overall app footprint
