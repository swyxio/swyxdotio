Given [the wide range of Netlify products and features](https://www.netlify.com/products/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=netlifyintroblogpost_swyx&utm_campaign=devex), statistically speaking, you're probably unaware of something Netlify does that might dramatically improve the way you deploy modern web apps!

For example, most users who use Netlify's [Continuous Deployment](https://www.netlify.com/docs/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=netlifyintroblogpost_swyx&utm_campaign=devex) might want to take better advantage of [Custom Domains](https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=netlifyintroblogpost_swyx&utm_campaign=devex) and [Managed DNS](https://www.netlify.com/docs/dns/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=netlifyintroblogpost_swyx&utm_campaign=devex).

Or you might use [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=netlifyintroblogpost_swyx&utm_campaign=devex) for contact pages and file uploads via vanilla HTML form submission, and be unaware that you can [send and retrieve form submissions via JavaScript](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/07/20/how-to-integrate-netlifys-form-handling-in-a-react-app/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=netlifyintroblogpost_swyx&utm_campaign=devex#form-handling-with-static-site-generators).

Or you might want to [get started with serverless functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/#javascript-lambda-functions?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=netlifyintroblogpost_swyx&utm_campaign=devex) and have no idea where to start.

The Netlify team has done excellent [docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=netlifyintroblogpost_swyx&utm_campaign=devex) and [blogposts](https://www.netlify.com/blog/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=netlifyintroblogpost_swyx&utm_campaign=devex) and [talks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8bRyfU7ycLXnEBfvdorpUg/videos) and [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW9cPKFSUrw) and [talks](https://vimeo.com/348717993) but everyone's learning style is different!

## Netlify ❤️ FreeCodeCamp

We are big fans of FreeCodeCamp and [recently collaborated with them](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-and-deploy-websites-using-netlify-a-comprehensive-tutorial/) to record an extended tutorial to walk you through everything you can possibly want to know about Netlify and how its various products and features can link together to create a full JAMstack app!
