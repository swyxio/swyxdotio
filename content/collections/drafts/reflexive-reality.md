Disparate threads of a common idea abound:

- George Soros noted the reflexivity in markets where increasing consensus of a recession causes CEOs to cut back on investment, precipitating the recession
- In Small Gods, Terry Pratchett wrote about Gods fueled and made real and made powerful by belief
- His collaborator Neil Gaiman did the same in American Gods, less fantasy, more modern/historical commentary

In the pursuit of science, we try to only believe in real things. However in the human/social sphere, Belief causes reality.
